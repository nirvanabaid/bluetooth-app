Here's the corrected version of the README with grammar errors fixed:

**TRAKR**

This is the home screen of the app. When Bluetooth is enabled for the first time, the app will ask for permissions. Please provide all the permissions requested by the app.

**CONNECT TO DEVICE**

[NOTE: Before connecting the device through the app, pair the device to the phone from settings.]

Toggle on the 'Enable Bluetooth' button if it's not already enabled, then click on the 'Connect to a device' button.

![Device Discovery Screen](https://github.com/nirvanabaid/bluetooth-app/blob/main/app_screenshots/photo_2023-11-01%2013.54.53.jpeg?raw=true)

A list of paired devices will be shown, and the available devices will be highlighted. Click on the device you want to use.

If you want to rediscover devices, click on the refresh button in the top right corner.

![Device Choosing Screen](https://github.com/nirvanabaid/bluetooth-app/blob/main/app_screenshots/photo_2023-11-01%2013.54.51.jpeg?raw=true)

Choose the type of device to be used. If a custom command is needed, choose the 'read and write' option.

[NOTE: In the case of FP and canLogger, there is a text box for a custom command, so the 'read and write' option shouldn't be used.]

![Custom command for FP and canLogger]([https://github.com/nirvanabaid/bluetooth-app/blob/main/app_screenshots/photo_2023-11-01%2013.54.48.jpeg?raw=true](https://github.com/nirvanabaid/bluetooth-app/blob/main/app_screenshots/photo_2023-11-01%2013.54.45.jpeg?raw=true))

After choosing the device, select the command option. If the command returns something, it will be displayed in a dialogue box.

If the command is used for sending data to the device, a dialog with a list of attributes will be shown. Make sure to fill in all the attributes before clicking the 'configure' button.

If "Chat Log" is displayed in the app header instead of "Live Chat," it means that the device is disconnected. To reconnect, click on the refresh button in the top right corner.

If, during any process, the app starts to behave abnormally or the desired output is not shown on the summary screen, try restarting the app.
